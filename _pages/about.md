Thanks for visiting!


I am Palash Roy. Now I am working as a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Dhaka (DU)](https://www.du.ac.bd/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Masters of Science (M.Sc.) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Dhaka (DU)](https://www.du.ac.bd/), Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Previously, I worked as a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in [Green University of Bangladesh (GUB)](https://green.edu.bd/) From October 2020 to February 2025. I also served as a mentor of the IEEE Student Branch, GUB. Previously, I also worked as a chair of the IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter, University of Dhaka from September 2020 to December 2022. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing, AI-based approaches for network applications design, etc.
